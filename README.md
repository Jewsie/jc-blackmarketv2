## Resume ##
So since there's been a new update, and I haven't exactly been back at RedM for the most part, but since the previous blackmarket script was widely successful and seems like people really liked the remake and compatible one made by the great @rms_dnb 

I thought I would just make a new one on this one, it's fairly simple but has different design and set up a little differently, also allows for selling and buying different items for each blackmarket.

## Features ##
- Add multiple locations and blackmarkets
- Add different buyable and sellable items for each blackmarket
- Add different pets for each blackmarket
- Toggle whether there's a limit to buying and selling items

## Items Used ##
